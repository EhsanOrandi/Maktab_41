        <p>This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an empty box for his birthday. He may <i>look</i> happy, but he's a <i>little</i> disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few things in the box.</p>
        <p>Jack would really like...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Roller blades</li>
            <li>Magic tricks</li>
            <li>Anything pokemon</li>
            <li>A motorized Lego set</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can get all this (and more) at an online toy store. Two very popular ones are <a href="https://www.toysrus.com">toysrus.com</a> and <a href="https://www.toysrus.com">eToys</a>.</p>
